\usage{
eFrameRM(y, y1, cells, Z, type, siteCovs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{An MxJ matrix of the observed removal data, where M is the
number of sites and J is the maximum number of removal (primary)
periods per site. Each primary period can consist of k secondary
periods but this is not used here.}

\item{y1}{An NxJ matrix of the additional monitoring data, where N is the
number of monitored sites and J is the maximum number of primary periods
per site as for \code{y}.}

\item{cells}{vector indictaing which of the \code{y} sites were subject
to monitoring}

\item{Z}{integer indicating the number of secondary periods per
primary period for \code{y1}}

\item{type}{sampling method}
}
\value{
a \code{eFrameRM} holding data containing the response and
 covariates required for removal models
}
\description{
\code{eFrameRM} creates an eFrameRM data object for use with removal models
that include additional monitoring at some or all of the sites.
